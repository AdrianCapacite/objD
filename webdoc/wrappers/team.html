The team Wiget is a wrapper for the team command and allows you to group entities together and apply group rules.

There are a few constructors:

**Team(String)** - just adds a new team
**Team.add(String,[options])** - adds the team and also applies some modifiers to it(take a look at Team.modify)
**Team.empty(String)** - clears the team and removes all entities in it
**Team.join(String, Entity)** - adds the entity to the team(an entity can only be in one team at a time)
**Team.leave(Entity)** - the entity is removed from their current team

|Team.modify or Team.add| |
|--|--|
|String|name of the team|
|display|TextComponent showing the team name in chat or scoreboard|
|color| the teams Color |
|nametag| Either ModifyTeam.[always,never,hideForOtherTeam,hideForOwnTeam] |
|collision| Either ModifyTeam.[always,never,pushOtherTeams,pushOwnTeam] |
|deathMessage|Either ModifyTeam.[always,never,hideForOtherTeam,hideForOwnTeam] |
|friendlyFire|Should a member be able to hit a team mate?(bool)|
|seeInvisisble|Should a member be able to see an invisible team mate?(bool)|
|prefix| a String showing in front of a player name |
|suffix| a String showing after a player name |

**Example:**
```dart
Team.add(
	"test",
	collision:ModifyTeam.always,
	color:Color.Red,
	display:  TextComponent("Hello"),
	friendlyFire:  true,
	suffix:  "Test",
	deathMessage:  ModifyTeam.hideForOwnTeam
)
⇒ team add test
⇒ team modify test displayName {"text":"Hello"}
⇒ team modify test color red
⇒ team modify test deathMessageVisibility hideForOwnTeam
⇒ team modify test friendlyFire true
⇒ team modify test collisionRule always
⇒ team modify test suffix Test
```
