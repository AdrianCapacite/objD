## Clone
The clone command clones an Area to another Location with different modes.

|constructor| |
|--|--|
|Area|The Area that you want to copy|
|to| A Location where to paste the area|

**Example:**
```dart
Clone(
	Area(x1:0,y1:0,z1:0,x2:10,y2:10,z2:10),
	to: Location.here()
)
⇒ clone 0 0 0 10 10 10 ~ ~ ~
```
There are also the masked and replace modes:

|Clone.masked or Clone.replace| |
|--|--|
|Area|...|
|to|...|
|mode| a String assembling another option(optional. either normal, force or move)|

The same goes with `Clone.filtered` but it also accepts a property called block to just copy the specified block

**Example:**
```dart
Clone.filtered(
	Area(x1:0,y1:0,z1:0,x2:10,y2:10,z2:10),
	to: Location.here(),
	block: Block.air,
	mode: "move"
)
⇒ clone 0 0 0 10 10 10 ~ ~ ~ filtered minecraft:air move
```
