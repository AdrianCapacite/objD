## Execute
One of the most used commands has a widget too. The execute command has multiple syntaxes that allow to manipulate the position, executer or condition.

|constructor | |
|--|--|
|children|a List of children that should be executed(required)|
|encapsulate|weither the children should be in an extra file for a certain length |
| as | an [Entity](#entity) that runs the commands|
|at|an [Entity](#entity) from where the command should run|
|If| a Condition that must be true to execute the commands|
|location| a Location or Entity from where to run the commands |
|align| String with align statements e.g: "xyz" |
|anchor|either Facing.eyes or Facing.feet|
|facing| A Location or Entity to rotate to |
|rotation| A rotation of type [Rotation](#rotation)|
|dimension|Dimension of overworld, the_end or the_nether|
|targetFilePath|force the group to use this path instead of `/objd/`|
|targetFileName|force the group to use this name instead of automatic generated names|

All Execute classes are also an Group, so they will group commands in seperate files and allow multiple children.
Example:
```dart
Execute(
	as: Entity.player(),
	at: Entity.Selected(),
	If: Condition.entity(Entity())
	location: Location.here(),
	align: "yz",
	anchor: Facing.eyes,
	facing: Location().glob(x:0,y:0,z:0)
	rotation: Rotation.rel(x:10,y:20),
	dimension: Dimension.the_nether
	children: List<Widget> [
		Command("/say I get executed")
		Say("Me too")
	]
),

⇒ execute as @p at @s if entity @e positioned ~ ~ ~ align yz anchored eyes facing 0 0 0 rotated ~10 ~20 in the_nether run say I get executed
  execute as @p at @s if entity @e positioned ~ ~ ~ align yz anchored eyes facing 0 0 0 rotated ~10 ~20 in the_nether run say Me too
```

|Execute. as | |
|--|--|
|Entity|the entity from which the children should run|
|children|a List of children that should be executed|
|[encapsulate]|same as base |

This is just a different notation for Execute.
```dart
Execute.as(
	Entity.player(),
	children: List<Widget> [
		Command("/say I get executed")
	]
),

⇒ execute as @p run say I get executed
```

|Execute. at | |
|--|--|
|Entity|the entity from where the children should run|
|children|a List of children that should be executed|
|[encapsulate]|same as base |

```dart
Execute.at(
	Entity.player(),
	children: List<Widget> [
		Command("/say I get executed")
	]
),

⇒ execute at @p run say I get executed
```

|Execute.asat | |
|--|--|
|Entity|the entity from which and where the children should run|
|children|a List of children that should be executed|
|[encapsulate]|same as base |

Asat combines as and at to just one entity.
```dart
Execute.asat(
	Entity.player(),
	children: List<Widget> [
		Command("/say I get executed")
	]
),

⇒ execute as @p at @s run say I get executed
```

|Execute.positioned| |
|--|--|
|Entity\|Location|the new position |
|...||

Positioned sets the execution point of the command to a new Location or Entity.
```dart
Execute.positioned(
	Entity.player(), // Location...
	children: List<Widget> [
		Command("/say I get executed")
	]
),

⇒ execute positioned as @p run say I get executed
```


|Execute.align| |
|--|--|
|String|representation of the alignment |
|...||

Aligns the position to the corners of the block grid.

|Execute.anchored| |
|--|--|
|Facing|Facing.eyes or Facing.feet |
|...||

Sets the execution position(^ ^ ^) to the eyes or the feet.


|Execute.facing| |
|--|--|
|Entity or Location|the target to face(required) |
|facing| either face the Facing.eyes(default) or Facing.feet |
|...||

Sets the execution rotation so that it faces a location or an entity's feet or eyes.
**Example:**
```dart
Execute.facing(
	Entity.player(), // or Location...
	facing: Facing.feet // optional
	children: List<Widget> [
		Command("/say I get executed")
	]
)
⇒ execute facing entity @p feet run say I get executed
```


|Execute.rotated| |
|--|--|
|Rotation|the rotation object |
|...||

Sets the execution rotation to the given rotation.

|Execute.dimension| |
|--|--|
|Dimension|the given dimension type |
|...||

Sets the execution dimension(execute in) to either `Dimension.overworld`, `Dimension.the_end` or `Dimension.the_nether`.

### Methods
All of these constructors are also available as methods with some additional utils:

|Methods|  |
|--|--|
| center | centeres the alignment(middle of the block) |

That means you can chain the actions, like with score, and use multiple actions at once:

```dart
// declaring the base
Execute ex = Execute(
	children:[
		Say("Hello"),
		Command("say e")
	]
)
// in the generate method:
ex.asat(
Entity.All())
	.center()
	.positioned(Location.rel(x:0,y:20,z:0))
⇒ execute as @a at @s align xyz positioned ~0.5 ~0.5 ~0.5 positioned ~ ~20 ~ run say Hello
   execute as @a at @s align xyz positioned ~0.5 ~0.5 ~0.5 positioned ~ ~20 ~ run say e
```
