## Why a framework?
A framework is a set of utilities to reduce the amount of repetitive work.
I've tried many ways in the past to achieve a quick and easy way to generate Datapacks for Minecraft: A own programming language [mcscript](https://stevertus.com/mcscript), several graphical online generators at [stevertus.com](https://stevertus.com) or premade utilities.

Instead of developing a language, why not using the tools and parser an other language gives you?
By building a custom frame around it you get the **reliability** and the **extensive** debugging tools in Editors.

The generation of Datapacks is **easy**,**fast** and aims to be **less repetitive** and **modular** by utilizing the concept of Widgets as one of the main features.
