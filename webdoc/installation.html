You need the Dart SDK for this framework. Download and install it from https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk

I would also recommend Visual Studio Code along with the dart plugin to edit dart files very conveniently.

Make a new folder that will house your project wherever you want(I would recommend datapacks folder).

And inside of that create a file named `pubspec.yaml` and another folder called `lib`.

Open the pubspec.yaml file and add 
```yaml
name: [unique_namespace]
dependencies:  
   objd: ^0.2.4
```
Also remember to replace the `[unique_namespace]` with your own project name.
And run 
```
$  pub get
```
with the console in the new folder(VS code does this automatically)

> Tip: You can also generate a full project with a console command. [read more](https://stevertus.com/objD/documentation/Global%20Commands)
