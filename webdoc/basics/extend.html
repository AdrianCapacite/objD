## Extend
Extend is very similar to File, but instead of creating a new file it adds content to an existing file.

|constructor | |
|--|--|
| String | the desired file path going from `/data/:packId:/functions/` on |
| child| the additional content|
| [first] | Boolean if the content should be added in front of the original(def. false) |

So lets say we already have some files in our pack, but want to add something to the main file somewhere entirely else in our project:

```dart
Extend(
	"main",
	child: Command("say okay"),
	first: true
)
``` 
This would add the command `say okay` in front of our main.mcfunction.
