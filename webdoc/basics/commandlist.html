## CommandList
But there is a more efficient way to list raw Minecraft commands. The CommandList Widget allows you to input a List of Commands, a List of Strings representing a command or a multiline string.

|constructor | |
|--|--|
| List| a list of commands or strings |

This has basically the same function as For.of just for commands.
  
```dart
CommandList(List<Command>[
		Command('say 1'),
		Command('say 2'),
		Command('say 3')
]),
```
But there is also a subset which accepts one big multiline string:

|CommandList.str| |
|--|--|
| String| list of commands each on a seperate line |

```dart
CommandList.str("""
	/say 1
	/say 2
	/say 3
"""),
```
The slashes are automatically filtered out.
