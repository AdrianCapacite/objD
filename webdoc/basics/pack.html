A pack is logically the next step. This defines a sub-pack with an name again that will be our namespace afterwards.
Here we can also define included files as well as the main and load function:

|constructor | |
|--|--|
| name | the name of the sub-pack|
| [main]| the main file that is ran every tick |
| [load] | the load file that is ran on reload |
| [files] | A List of type File witch includes other needed files |
| [modules] | used to inject a List of Modules(read more about modules in the Modules section) |

**Example:**
```dart
Pack(
	name:"tpcraft",
	main: File(...),
	load: File(...),
	modules: [
		MyModule()
	]
	files: List<File> [
		File(...)
	]
)
```
The Pack class can be used as often as you want and where you want, so you can also define a new pack in some file.

> Notice: The namespace of the pack is accessible in these files by using the context variable. e.g:
> `Command("function" + context.packId + ":run")`
