## Scoreboard
A scoreboard objective holds values, kind a like a Variable inside Minecraft. The Scoreboard class just handles adding or removing objectives. The value assignment is handled by the Score class.

|constructor|  |
|--|--|
|String|name of the objective(required)|
|type|the objective type (default = dummy)|
|display|TextComponent that displays the name|
|addIntoLoad|bool whether the scoreboard should be added into your load file(default = true)|

objD automatically keeps a list of all scoreboards and inserts them into the given load file, ignoring doubled names.
**Example:**
```dart
Scoreboard(
"death_count",
type: "deathCount",
display: TextComponent("This is how many deaths you have:"),
addIntoLoad: true
)
Scoreboard("death_count")

// load.mcfunction:
/scoreboard objectives add death_count deathCount [{"text":"This is how many deaths you have:"}]
```
So the second scoreboard was not added because one "death_count" already existed.

The `Scoreboard.add` constructor does exactly the same but puts the result without checking in the current file.

`Scoreboard.remove` removes an objective by its name again.

With `Scoreboard.setdisplay` you can display the values:

|Scoreboard.setdisplay|  |
|--|--|
|String|name of the objective(required)|
|display|String for display location (default = sidebar)|
