The group groups actions similar to for but has an option to prefix each action and encapsulate the content in a new file.

|constructor | |
|--|--|
| prefix| a prefix type of String |
|children|the underlying widgets|
|[suffix]| a String that should be added at the end |
|[filename]| the targeted filename(will be combined with an unique id) |
|[groupMin]|the minimum amount of children to encapsulate(default = 3, set to -1 to disable) |

If the children length is larger or equal groupMin a new file is created in `/objD/`(the working directory for objectiveD) and executed.
```dart
Group(
	prefix: "execute as @e run "
	children: List<Widget>[
		Command('say 1'),
		Command('say 2'),
		Command('say 3')
	],
	filename: "asgroup",
	groupMin: 2
),
```
