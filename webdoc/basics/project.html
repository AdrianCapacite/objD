The project is a special Widget which is just defined once. It contains some built options, like description or name, but also the entire underlying tree of packs, files and actions.

|constructor | |
|--|--|
| name | the name of the datapack folder |
| generate| a widget that defines the projects content |
| [description] | A description that will go in pack.mcmeta |

**Example:**
```dart
main() {
// create Project takes in one project and compiles it
createProject(
	Project(
	name:  "tested",
	generate:  mainWidget(),
	));
}
```
