The [Pack]() class already required some files. The file class simply generates a new mcfunction file with content and a path.

The File constructor has two required arguments:

|constructor | |
|--|--|
| path | the desired file path going from `/data/:packId:/functions/` on |
| child| the content of the file |
| execute | bool if the function should be executed directly(optional) |
| create | bool if the file should be created or just interpreted with execute(optional, default = true)|

The File class can be used as often as you want and where you want, so you can also define a new file in a For container for example.
**Example:**
```dart
Pack(
	name:"tpcraft",
	main: File(
		path:"main",
		// and defining a new file inside of an widget
		child: File.execute( // same as execute: true
			path: 'new'
			child: Command(...)
		)
	),
)
```
