## Block
There is also a util class called Block which provides a wrapper for all available blocks in Minecraft.
**Usage:**
```dart
Block([minecraft_block_id]) // as string or
Block.[minecraft_block_id]
```
All ids can be found [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block#List_of_blocks).
But you can also insert a block by its string:

|constructor | |
|--|--|
|String|the minecraft block id|


Example:
```dart
SetBlock(
	Block.stone,
	location: Location.here()
)
```
