There is also a util class called Block which provides a wrapper for all available blocks in Minecraft.
**Usage:**
```dart
Block([minecraft_block_id]) // as string or
Block.[minecraft_block_id]
```
All ids can be found [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block#List_of_blocks).
But you can also insert a block by its string:

|constructor | |
|--|--|
|String|the minecraft block id|


Example:
```dart
SetBlock(
	Block.stone,
	location: Location.here()
)
```
### Block.nbt
This is a special function that creates a block with the option to add nbt data and blockstates.

| Block.nbt |  |
|--|--|
| Block or String | the Block type |
| states | a Map of Blockstates(e.g {"left":true}, optional) |
| nbt | Nbt in form of a Dart Map(optional)|
|strNbt| Nbt in a pure String format, allows for 1b etc(optional)|

With this function you can fully configure your blocks.
