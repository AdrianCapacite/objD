## Timer
A Timer is very similar to a Timeout, but instead of delaying the code it is run over and over again always delayed by the ticks. In the end it creates a loop with slower tick speed as 20t/s to perform some operations more performant.

| constructor |  |
|--|--|
| String | the name of the timeout(used as filename) |
| children | the content that should be delayed |
| ticks | the delay as integer ticks |
|infinite| should it run infinitely? (default = true) |
| path |the folder path(optional, default = "timers")|

**Example:**
```dart
Timer(
	"timer1",
	children: [Say("Timer reached")],
	ticks: 100
)
⇒ function example:timers/timer1
// timers/timer1:
⇒ say Timer reached
⇒ schedule function example:timers/timer1 100t
```
It is recommended to start these timers in your load function. 

With a finite timer, you can also stop the timer with `Timer.stop`:

```dart
Timer(
	"timer2",
	infinite:false,
	children: [Say("Timer reached")],
	ticks: 10
)
Timer.stop("timer2")
```
This uses a tag internally to stop scheduling the next timeout if the tag is existing.
